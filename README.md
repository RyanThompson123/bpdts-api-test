## BPDTS API Test by Ryan Thompson
BPDTS Code Test to create an API to return people who live in London or are within 60 miles of London.

# Info

The base application was generated by (Spring Initializr)[https://start.spring.io/]. It is a sprint boot microservice which fetches data from https://bpdts-test-app-v3.herokuapp.com/ processes it and via 2 endpoints displayed in the Endpoints section.

This application has also been containerised using Docker.

The coordinates I have used for central London were from a google search i found these to be 51.5074° N, 0.1277° W and have based my work aroud this.

# Running

To run the application:

1. Clone the repository

2. Run "mvn clean package"

3. Run: "docker build -t ryanthompson123/bpdtstestapi ."

4. Run: "docker run -p 8080:8080 ryanthompson123/bpdtstestapi"

5. The application will now be running on port 8080

# Endpoints

http://localhost:8080/get-users - will return a full list of users

http://localhost:8080/get-users/london - will return a list of user London and within 60 miles of London

# Testing

To test this API i have used Junit and Mockito.
